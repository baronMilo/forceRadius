# forceRadius
This is a positioning force that move nodes along a radius, given a start and end position (in radians).
The direction a node will travel depends on the shortest distance, i.e. if the radians between the starting and ending point is larger than PI it will travel counter-clockwise, otherwise it will be clockwise.
